# value_estimation_vs_effort_mobilization
This repository contains the scripts used for the tasks and analysis of our "Value estimation versus effort mobilization: a general dissociation between ventromedial and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex" paper. Anyone who has questions is invited to contact me at nicolas.clairis at protonmail.com

To launch the task, you just have to launch one of the following three tasks within the "task" folder:
- taskLearning75.m for the learning task
- taskMentalRP.m for the Stroop task
- taskGripRP.m for the grip task.
The script will then ask you to provide a subject number, the session number (which has to be between 0 and 8 by default, script has to be modified if you want to change that) and whether you plan to use the SR ResearchLight Eyetracker or not.

To perform the analysis, you may use the following scripts depending on the analysis you want to perform:
