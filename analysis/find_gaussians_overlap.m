function [ X1, X2 ] = find_gaussians_overlap(muA, sigmaA, muB, sigmaB )
%[ X1, X2 ] = find_gaussians_overlap(muA, sigmaA, muB, sigmaB )
% find_gaussians_overlap will give you the one (or two) solutions for which
% there can be an overlap between two gaussian curves A(muA, sigmaA) and B(muB, sigmaB) following a normal distribution.
%
% INPUTS
% muA: mean of distribution A
%
% sigmaA: variance of distribution A
%
% muB: mean of distribution B
%
% sigmaB: variance of distribution B
%
% OUTPUTS
% X1, X2: 2 solutions to see for which values of X, the two gaussians
% overlap
% Note: X1 should be smaller than X2
%
% Note: when sigmaA=sigmaB, only one solution, so that output X1=X2

    a = (1/(sigmaA^2)) - (1/(sigmaB^2));

    %% extract 2 possible solutions
    X1 = (-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c))/(2*a + eps); % a can be negative in that case, X1 will be higher than X2 => that's why reordered afterwards
    X2 = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c))/(2*a + eps);

    %% order them in ascending order
